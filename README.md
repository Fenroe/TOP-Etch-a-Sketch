# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch
Done as part of The Odin Project

SLow progress on this project not due to the difficulty but the extreme weather. It's been difficult to focus on the work in this heat.

Hit a wall in the project. Figuring out a way to fill the space with a variable amount of tiles in a good way is proving difficult.

The wall I hit was much easier to overcome once I wrote about it in here, the real issue came with attempting to clear the sketch space. I settled on using a for loop to iterate through an array of elements, with going through the array backwards the only logical solution to the problem.
